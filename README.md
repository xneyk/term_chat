# TERM_CHAT
Hey there! My name is Edgar and I'm a software engineering student.

That's a small project just for figuring out how sockets works. The main focus is to make a simple terminal chat where two known friends can talk on a termporaly chat.

## Instalation
Here I will explain how to install this project and how you can run it :)

## Build and Run!
First of all, you need to compile everything to get the binary file. You can do that running the following on the root directory of the project.
```
make
```
